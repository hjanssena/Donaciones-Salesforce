## Overview

The **Mexico Dreamin Donation Portal** is a Salesforce-backed fundraising platform designed to help SF Vibe Lab students cover ticket, travel, and lodging expenses to attend **Mexico Dreamin 2026** in Mexico City.

### Key Capabilities
- **Public Donation Portal (No Login Required):** Visitors can browse active fundraising campaigns, view real-time progress toward financial goals, and see publicly recognized donors (`RF-V1`, `RF-D1a`, `RF-D1b`).
- **Three Donation Modalities:**
  - **Anonymous (`RF-D2`):** Donor identity is completely hidden from all public views and email receipts.
  - **Credited (`RF-C1`):** Donor's name and contribution amount appear on the campaign's public donor wall once paid.
  - **Invoiced (`RF-F1`, `RF-F2`):** Captures and validates the donor's legal name and Mexican tax ID (`RFC` pattern check) and flags the donation for staff follow-up.
- **Stripe Test Checkout & Webhook Automation:** Pre-registers `Pending` donations in Salesforce before redirecting to Stripe Test Mode (`RF-D3`, `RF-D4`), and automatically confirms payments and sends email receipts via Stripe webhooks (`RF-D5`, `RF-V3a`, `RF-V3b`).
- **Internal Staff & Treasury Console:** Allows coordination and treasury staff to manage campaigns (`RF-S1`), oversee all donations (`RF-S2`), manually confirm payments (`RF-S3`), and audit automatic confirmations and rejected webhooks (`RF-S4`).
